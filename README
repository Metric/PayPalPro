This was the last version of the PayPalPro payment module for Virtuemart 1.1.x that was developed in conjuction with PayPal and the creator of Virtuemart. 

It was fully certified by PayPal for use in Germany and the U.S.

I am posting this here for historical reasons and in case people need it! As it appears some people still prefer to use Virtuemart 1.1.x over 1.2.x.

Installation is simple, just unzip the files first and copy the files over via ftp. The plugin is installed like every other joomla plugin.
