###Version 2.1 PayPalPro - 02-03-11
Several Major Bug Fixes: Coupon discount is now applied properly
						 Virtuemart credit card option no longer tries to send the user
						 to PayPal Express.

Additional: Item name on PayPal now includes attributes and SKU number.

Known Issues: The shipping method name must use ASCII characters when using PayPal Express
			  There is currently no fix for this, because PayPal mangles any special unicode
			  characters when sent back through a return url (Even when the unicode is encoded for html / url).

###Version 2.0.3 PayPalPro - 05-24-10
Bug Fixes: Fixed a Javascript bug that did not allow IE to use the
		   PayPal Express Button at the Payment Selection Screen.
		   
Additional: As requested a template variable has been added to allow
            for the adding of the PayPal Express Button in shop.cart.tpl.php
			
			Please see the install page on how to add the variable to shop.cart.tpl.php
			and remove the variable from basket_b2b.html.php & basket_b2c.html.php

###Version 2.0.2 PayPalPro - 05-15-10
Bug Fixes: Fixed an issue where the Pay Pal Express checkout was not properly
           Using the Virtuemart Secure URL for the return URLS.

Additional: Added a change log file to the zip
            Added the license agreement to the zip.

###Version 2.0.1 PayPalPro - 05-06-10
Bug Fixes: Fixed the issue of the payment module not playing nice with other
           payment modules. Previously only PayPalPro could be active and some
           of the other payment modules would not be listed if you turned off
           Direct Payment, or were using the Express Only version of PayPalPro.

###Version 2.0.0 PayPalPro - 05-05-10
